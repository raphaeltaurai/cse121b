Project proposal:
The final project aims to develop an application that provides articles on data structures and algorithms.
The application will allow users to filter and select specific topics of interest, with the default 
display showing all the available articles. The project will be implemented using JavaScript and will 
consume external data in JSON format from either Algorithmia, LeetCode or Data.gov.
